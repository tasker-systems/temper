-- The blob arm learns to NAME, not to strike (the blob-arm ruling, ruled 2026-09-11 with
-- Pete — the resolution of the named-open recorded on 20260911000000's home-pure block).
-- A guest-committed blob row homed in the subject's governed context is the guest's own
-- content — accepted as surviving (reads are closed by the context floor; its existence is
-- no new information to the guest) — but it must not be SILENT: the 2026-09-06 pattern is
-- "the remainder is named, never silent", and these rows were the act's only un-named class
-- (20260911000000's pre-pass enumerated by actor halves, so it reported nothing for them).
--
-- principal_erasure_execute gains a second blob pass, and the estate's blobs are enumerated
-- BY HOME: every LIVE row homed in a governed context whose actor halves are not the
-- subject's is named in the targets, independent_obligation-shaped with its blob id +
-- content hash, exactly as team-held rows are named. The subject's own strikes, their
-- byte-release verdicts, and the strike-outcome template are BYTE-UNCHANGED
-- (20260909000025's v1 shape, which the fence parses by exact prefix —
-- erasure_fence_service::classify_blob_outcome); both new outcomes carry the same
-- 'independent_obligation: ' known non-delete-target prefix. Named hashes never enter
-- kb_erased_content — only strikes do.
--
-- The record stays honest about the two accepted remainders: an UNATTACHED guest row has no
-- custodian once the home owner is the tombstoned subject, so its provider bytes are
-- retained with no release path (its outcome says so); an ATTACHED one (a live relation to
-- a resource) remains strikable by a guest holding delete standing (its outcome says that).
--
-- Additive: CREATE OR REPLACE only, signature unchanged (the 20260804000020 class).
