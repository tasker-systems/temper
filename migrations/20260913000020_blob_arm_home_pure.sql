-- The blob arm goes home-pure (task 01a09628 item 1, ruled 2026-09-12 with Pete — decision
-- 01a097ff-0aa1-7183-bd57-7044286123e8): every live blob row homed in a governed context of
-- the erased estate strikes with the estate, whoever committed it. The 2026-09-11 blob-arm
-- ruling (name-not-strike; 20260911000010's guest naming pass) is superseded by derivation
-- from the scope-of-engagement ruling: writing into someone's private context declares the
-- content's scope of engagement — it lives and dies with that estate. Resources have followed
-- that line since 20260911000000; blobs do now too. The actor arms' role as the
-- strike-deciding scope retires — they remain in the enumeration only as breadth for the
-- disposition-iii team remainder — and the record names no undischargeable obligation of the
-- estate, because none remains.
--
-- The accepted cost is stated, not discovered: a guest's bytes die on someone else's erasure.
-- The mitigation is deliberately NOT in the act — the commit door discloses the scope of
-- engagement at the moment of writing, and the terms-of-use documentation carries the line.
--
-- The strike machinery is UNCHANGED: guest rows join the same ordered strike set and leave
-- through the same blob_delete('blob_erased', …) wrapper — per-row events, the sequential
-- refcount under the hash lock deciding provider release, the strike prose the fence parses
-- by exact prefix. principal_erasure_execute and principal_erasure_survey consume the plan
-- by id and keep their bodies; the plan's and the act's COMMENTs are restated here (the
-- survey's rendering-only claims are unchanged and its COMMENT stands).
--
-- Additive: CREATE OR REPLACE of one function + COMMENTs, signatures unchanged (the
-- 20260804000020 class).

-- THE shared erasure computation — the act's own scope machinery, read-only (the body moved
-- whole from principal_erasure_execute in 20260913000010). The act consumes the plan
-- (computed ONCE per act; strikes consume its rows by id, in plan order; nothing
-- re-enumerates) and the survey door serves the same plan: same-state, the survey predicts
-- each strike's verdict under the act's own sequential refcount — same-hash rows earlier in
-- the strike set are already emptied when the act reaches this row — and the wrapper's
-- strike-time verdict stays authoritative for writers after the survey. LIVE governed-home
-- blob rows are the would-strike entries, whoever committed them (home-pure since
-- 20260913000020 — the scope-of-engagement ruling applied to the second content kind);
-- struck governed-home
-- rows report already-erased; the subject's own rows in ungoverned homes keep the named
-- team remainder (disposition iii). Every other target keeps the act's exact prose, in the
-- act's exact order.

its named guest class retire; a guest''s bytes are scoped to that estate at commit and
disclosed there. Read-only: it appends no event, mutates no row.
principal_erasure_execute consumes this plan (computed ONCE per act; strikes by id, in
