-- Beat 2b N1: give the R4 node projection a first-body-chunk column so the
-- neighborhood slice can derive a body excerpt (via compute_excerpt in Rust).
-- Additive over the shipped 20260703130000 graph_atlas_nodes. RETURNS TABLE gains
-- a column, so DROP + CREATE (CREATE OR REPLACE cannot change OUT columns).
-- graph_atlas_nodes is called only from Rust (neighborhood_slice); no SQL dependents.
