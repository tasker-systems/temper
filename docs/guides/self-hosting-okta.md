# Self-Hosting Temper with Okta

This guide is the **Okta variant** of [Self-Hosting Temper](./self-hosting.md). It covers only the parts that differ when your identity provider is **Okta** instead of Auth0 — the authorization server, the application registrations, and the resulting environment and CLI configuration.

**Read the [main self-hosting guide](./self-hosting.md) first.** Everything outside of auth — the topology, provisioning Neon, deploying to Vercel, the `vercel.json` routing contract, and the verification steps — is identical. Only the "Provision Auth0" and "Configure the CLI" sections are replaced by what follows here.

**Scope:** API + MCP surfaces only, same as the main guide. The `temper-ui` web application is out of scope.

## How Temper validates tokens (why Okta works at all)

Temper's API validates every request's JWT against three things only: the **issuer** (`AUTH_ISSUER`), the **audience** (`AUTH_AUDIENCE`), and the signing keys at `JWKS_URL`. The `AUTH_PROVIDER_NAME` value is a label attached to resolved profiles and the key used to cache resolved emails — it does **not** switch validation logic. This is why Okta works as a drop-in issuer: get the issuer, audience, and JWKS right and the tokens validate.

Two consequences shape the rest of this guide:

1. Temper requires a **custom audience** on its access tokens. Okta can only mint custom audiences from a **custom authorization server**, which requires the **API Access Management** add-on.
2. A few peripheral code paths (the CLI's `temper init` URL templating, and the server's `/userinfo` email fallback) currently assume the Auth0 URL shape. The workarounds are called out inline below.

## Prerequisite: API Access Management

Okta gives every org a built-in **org authorization server**, but it **cannot customize the audience** (`aud`) claim, and its access tokens are intended for Okta's own APIs — not for validation by your services. Temper needs a custom audience, so you **must** use a **custom authorization server**.

Custom authorization servers are part of Okta's **API Access Management** product — an optional, paid add-on in production orgs. **Confirm your tenant has API Access Management enabled before continuing.** Without it, there is no supported way to host Temper on Okta.

## Provision the custom authorization server

In the Okta Admin Console: **Security → API → Authorization Servers → Add Authorization Server.**

1. **Name** — e.g. `temper`.
2. **Audience** — set this to the value you will use for `AUTH_AUDIENCE` and `MCP_AUDIENCE` (e.g. `https://<instance>/api`). The access-token `aud` claim will carry this value, and Temper checks it on every request.

Once created, note the authorization server's **issuer URI**, shown on its Settings tab. It has the form:

```text
https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>
```

`<okta-domain>` is your Okta org domain (`<org>.okta.com`, `<org>.oktapreview.com`, or a custom domain). `<authServerId>` is the server's ID (the built-in default server uses the literal `default`; a server you create gets a generated ID like `aus1a2b3c...`).

> **No trailing slash.** Okta's issuer is `https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>` with no trailing slash. Auth0's issuer *requires* a trailing slash; Okta's must *not* have one. `AUTH_ISSUER` must match the token's `iss` claim exactly, so copy the issuer URI verbatim.

### Add an access policy and rule

Custom authorization servers **deny by default** — if a client matches no access policy, the token request fails. On the authorization server's **Access Policies** tab:

1. **Add Policy** — assign it to the apps you will create below (or to **All clients**).
2. **Add Rule** — in the rule's grant-type conditions, allow **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**. (These are the only grants Temper's CLI uses; see below.)

Without at least one policy + rule, login will fail even when every URL and ID is correct.

### Add an `email` claim to the access token (required)

Temper resolves the user's email from the access token's `email` claim. When that claim is absent it falls back to the OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint — but **that fallback currently assumes the Auth0 issuer URL shape and does not resolve correctly against an Okta custom authorization server.** On Okta you must therefore put `email` directly on the access token.

On the authorization server's **Claims** tab: **Add Claim** —

- **Name:** `email`
- **Include in token type:** **Access Token**
- **Value type:** Expression
- **Value:** `user.email`
- **Include in:** the scopes/policies your apps use (or "Any scope")

Without this claim, login fails with `Token missing email claim and userinfo lookup failed`. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations) for the underlying code issue.

## Provision the applications

The contract mirrors the main guide: **two native applications** (the web app is out of scope). Both are created under **Applications → Create App Integration → OIDC - OpenID Connect → Native Application**.

### 1. CLI native application

The `temper` CLI uses the **Authorization Code + PKCE** flow with a loopback relay — **not** the device authorization grant. Configure the app accordingly:

- **Grant types:** **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**. (Do not enable Device Authorization — Temper does not use it.)
- **Sign-in redirect URI:** `https://<instance>/api/auth/cli-callback`
- PKCE is required for native apps by default, which is exactly what the CLI sends.
- Assign the app to the custom authorization server's access policy (above).

The app's **Client ID** is the CLI client ID used in `config.toml` (below).

### 2. MCP native application

Create a second Native application for MCP clients (e.g. Claude Desktop):

- **Sign-in redirect URIs:** the callbacks for the MCP clients you support, e.g. `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`, `https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback`, `http://localhost`.
- Assign it to the custom authorization server's access policy.

This app's **Client ID** becomes `MCP_CLIENT_ID`.

> **Dynamic client registration is handled for you.** MCP's OAuth flow normally expects dynamic client registration (DCR), but Okta's DCR endpoint returns `403` for custom authorization servers unless called with an admin API token — which arbitrary MCP clients cannot do. Temper sidesteps this entirely: its `/oauth/register` endpoint is a proxy that returns the pre-registered `MCP_CLIENT_ID`. You do not need to enable or configure Okta DCR.

### Reading values from a live tenant

If your tenant is already configured, the `okta` CLI and the Okta management API can enumerate these values (authorization server issuer and audience, application client IDs). The Admin Console shows the same information on each authorization server's Settings tab and each application's General tab.

## Environment variable contract (Okta values)

Set these in your Vercel project. They follow the same contract as the [main guide's table](./self-hosting.md#environment-variable-contract); only the auth values differ.

| Variable | Surface | Okta value |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | api, mcp | `https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>` — **no trailing slash** |
| `JWKS_URL` | api, mcp | `https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>/v1/keys` |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | api | The custom authorization server's **Audience** value (e.g. `https://<instance>/api`) |
| `MCP_AUDIENCE` | mcp | Same as `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (one authorization server serves both surfaces) |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER_NAME` | api, mcp | **Keep `auth0`.** It is a profile label and email-cache key, not a validation switch; leave it at the default rather than inventing an `okta` value |
| `MCP_CLIENT_ID` | mcp | The MCP native application's Client ID |
| `MCP_BASE_URL` | mcp | `https://<instance>` — no trailing slash |

Everything else in the main guide's environment contract (`DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, `SQLX_OFFLINE`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, etc.) is provider-independent — set those exactly as the main guide describes.

## Configure the CLI (Okta)

> **`temper init` is Auth0-specific.** The wizard templates Auth0-shaped endpoints (`https://<domain>/authorize`, `https://<domain>/oauth/token`) and writes `provider = "auth0"`. It cannot emit Okta's `/oauth2/<authServerId>/v1/*` endpoints. For Okta, **write `~/.config/temper/config.toml` by hand** using the block below (or run `temper init`, then overwrite the `authorize_url` and `token_url` lines).

```toml
[cloud]
api_url = "https://<instance>"

[auth]
provider = "auth0"

[[auth.providers]]
name = "auth0"
authorize_url = "https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>/v1/authorize"
token_url = "https://<okta-domain>/oauth2/<authServerId>/v1/token"
client_id = "<cli-app-client-id>"
audience = "<custom-auth-server-audience>"
callback_url = "https://<instance>/api/auth/cli-callback"
scopes = ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"]
```

Notes:

- **`provider` and `name` must both be `auth0`** and must match each other. The value is a label the CLI uses to select the provider block; it does not need to read "okta". The OAuth flow is identical regardless of the name.
- `audience` is the custom authorization server's Audience value — the same string as `AUTH_AUDIENCE`.
- `scopes` includes `offline_access` so Okta issues a refresh token; keep it.

### Environment variable overrides

The same overrides documented in the main guide apply unchanged: `TEMPER_API_URL`, `TEMPER_PROVIDER`, and `TEMPER_TOKEN`. For a fully headless agent session, export `TEMPER_TOKEN` (a JWT minted by your Okta authorization server) alongside `TEMPER_API_URL`; no `config.toml` is needed.

## Connect MCP clients

Identical to the main guide — point MCP clients at `https://<instance>/mcp`. OAuth discovery (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`) and the `/oauth/register` DCR proxy are served by Temper itself, not by Okta, so MCP clients discover and register against your instance regardless of the upstream IdP. Ensure `MCP_CLIENT_ID` matches the Okta MCP native application and that the MCP clients' callback URLs are listed as sign-in redirect URIs on that application.

## Verify

Use the same verification steps as the [main guide](./self-hosting.md#verify): `/api/health`, `temper login`, and a resource round-trip. `temper login` opens a browser to your Okta authorization server's `/v1/authorize` endpoint and completes the Authorization Code + PKCE flow.

If login fails with `Token missing email claim and userinfo lookup failed`, the access-token `email` claim is not configured — revisit [Add an `email` claim to the access token](#add-an-email-claim-to-the-access-token-required).

## Known limitations

These are current Temper behaviors that the steps above work around. They are candidates for a future code fix, after which the workarounds could be dropped:

- **The `/userinfo` email fallback assumes the Auth0 issuer shape.** Temper builds the userinfo URL as `<issuer-without-trailing-slash>/userinfo`, which resolves for Auth0 but not for an Okta custom authorization server (whose userinfo endpoint is `<issuer>/v1/userinfo`). Until this is made issuer-shape-aware (or the userinfo endpoint is configurable), Okta deployments must place the `email` claim directly on the access token.
- **`temper init` cannot generate Okta configuration.** The wizard hardcodes Auth0 endpoint shapes and `provider = "auth0"`, so Okta operators must hand-write `config.toml`. A provider-aware init (or a `--provider okta` flag emitting `/oauth2/<id>/v1/*` URLs) would remove this step.

## Not covered

The exclusions from the [main guide](./self-hosting.md#not-covered--deferred) apply here too (temper-ui, multi-region Neon, alternative messaging backends). In addition, **SAML-based SSO** is not covered: Temper authenticates with bearer JWTs (OIDC), so enterprise SAML SSO is handled upstream by federating your SAML IdP into Okta, which continues to issue the OIDC tokens Temper validates. Temper itself is not a SAML service provider.
